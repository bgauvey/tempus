/*
 * Tempus Theme - Fonts Stub
 *
 * Font-face declarations are NOT included because:
 * 1. Radzen.Blazor package already provides all required fonts
 * 2. Material Symbols fonts are loaded by Radzen
 * 3. Font files would need to be downloaded separately
 *
 * If you need custom fonts, you can:
 * - Add @font-face declarations to your custom CSS files
 * - Reference fonts from a CDN
 * - Download fonts from Google Fonts or other sources
 *
 * Original Radzen fonts that would be loaded:
 * - Material Symbols Outlined (for icons)
 * - Source Sans Pro (for software/standard/humanistic themes)
 * - Roboto (for material theme)
 *
 * Since Tempus themes use Inter font family (defined in theme SCSS),
 * and Radzen provides Material Symbols, no additional fonts needed.
