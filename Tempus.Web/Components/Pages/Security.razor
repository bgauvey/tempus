            <h2 class="legal-section-title">1. Data Encryption</h2>
            <p class="legal-section-text">
                We use industry-leading encryption to protect your data at every stage:
            </p>
            <ul class="legal-list">
                <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted between your device and our servers is protected using TLS 1.3 (Transport Layer Security) with 256-bit encryption, ensuring your information cannot be intercepted or tampered with during transmission</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Your data is encrypted when stored on our servers using AES-256 encryption, the same standard used by governments and financial institutions worldwide</li>
                <li><strong>Database Encryption:</strong> All database connections use encrypted protocols, and sensitive fields are encrypted at the column level for additional protection</li>
                <li><strong>Backup Encryption:</strong> All backup files are encrypted using the same AES-256 standard before being stored in secure, geographically distributed locations</li>

            <ul class="legal-list">
                <li><strong>Secure Password Storage:</strong> Passwords are never stored in plain text. We use ASP.NET Core Identity with PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with SHA-256 hashing and individual salts for each password</li>
                <li><strong>Strong Password Requirements:</strong> Passwords must meet complexity requirements including minimum length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Optional MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password</li>
                <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Secure session tokens with automatic expiration and the ability to remotely log out of all devices</li>
                <li><strong>Account Lockout Protection:</strong> Automatic account lockout after multiple failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks</li>
                <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Internal systems use principle of least privilege, ensuring employees only have access to data necessary for their role</li>
