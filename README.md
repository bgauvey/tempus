## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) or later
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.8+) or Visual Studio Code with C# extension
- No database installation required (uses SQLite by default)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download

```bash
# If using git
git clone <repository-url>
cd Tempus

# Or simply extract the Tempus folder
```

### 2. Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Build the Solution

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
cd Tempus.Web
dotnet run
```

The application will start and be available at:
- HTTPS: `https://localhost:7001`
- HTTP: `http://localhost:5000`

### 5. Using Visual Studio

1. Open `Tempus.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Set `Tempus.Web` as the startup project
3. Press `F5` or click the Run button

## Database Configuration

By default, Tempus uses **SQLite** for easy setup and portability. The database file (`tempus.db`) is created automatically in the `Tempus.Web` directory on first run.

### SQLite (Default)

No configuration needed! The database is automatically created and managed. SQLite is perfect for:
- Development and testing
- Single-user deployments
- Portable applications
- Quick prototyping

### Switching to SQL Server

If you need SQL Server for production or multi-user scenarios:

1. Update `appsettings.json` connection string:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=TempusDb;User Id=sa;Password=YourPassword123!;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```

2. Update `Program.cs` to use SQL Server:
```csharp
// Change from UseSqlite to UseSqlServer
builder.Services.AddDbContext<TempusDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
```

3. Create and apply migrations:
```bash
cd Tempus.Infrastructure
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --startup-project ../Tempus.Web
dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../Tempus.Web
```
